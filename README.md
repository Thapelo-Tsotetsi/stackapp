stackapp
========

Information sharing webapp with social networking features.


This was created after a facebook group I run, where I help people gather and share information such as bursaries, learnerships, vacation works, internships and startup jobs. I believe there is need for merging all this posts throught each user contribution.

The app was launched on the 7th of May 2013 and is entirely based on Symfony 1.4 framework and tutorials. The contribution part uses beta release of firebase and is actively being developed.

The aplication is live here: www.stackapp.co.za
